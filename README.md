# GUNI-Intent-App

An Android application developed to demonstrate the usage of both **Implicit** and **Explicit** Intents.

## Features

This application provides a simple user interface with buttons that perform various actions by using different types of Intents.

- **Explicit Intent:**
  - **Open Login Activity:** Navigates from the main screen to a separate `LoginActivity` using an explicit intent. This shows how to start a specific, known component within the same application.

- **Implicit Intents:**
  - **Open Specific URL:** Opens a given URL (`https://www.google.com`) in the default web browser.
  - **Make a Call:** Initiates a phone call to a specified number. This requires the `CALL_PHONE` permission.
  - **Open Call Log:** Displays the system's call history.
  - **Open Gallery:** Launches the device's image gallery.
  - **Set Alarm:** Opens the system's alarm-setting interface.
  - **Open Camera:** Activates the device's camera.
